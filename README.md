This paper focuses on analyzing over 17,000 Twitter records of terrorists accounts to identify the most active and influential members of the network, as well as to examine how content spreads through the network
Terrorist organizations are increasingly using social networks to distribute propaganda and recruit new members. Understanding the ways in which these organizations utilize social media can help predict and prevent potential terrorist attacks. This document focuses on analyzing over 17,000 Twitter records of terrorists accounts to identify the most active and influential members of the network, as well as to examine how content spreads through the network. We have also identified the most important members in the network and analyzed how the network will be affected by removing them. Also, by dividing the network into distinct communities, we gained a deeper understanding of how those persons operates and what are the main keywords in their Twitter communication.
